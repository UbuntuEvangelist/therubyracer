= Passgen

Ruby gem for generating passwords quickly and easily. Although it is
suitable for use within Rails it has no Rails dependencies and can be used in
non-Rails applications as well.

== Install

  gem install cryptice-passgen --source http://gems.github.com

== Usage

The usage could not be easier. Just require and call the generate method:

  >> require 'rubygems'
  >> require 'passgen'
  >> Passgen::generate
  => "zLWCeS3xC9"

== Examples

  >> Passgen::generate
  => "zLWCeS3xC9"

  >> Passgen::generate(:length => 20)
  => "6lCcHvkuEW6OuzAtkoAs"

  >> Passgen::generate(:symbols => true)
  => "gr)$6bIym1"

  >> Passgen::generate(:lowercase => :only)
  => "ysbwuxbcea"

  >> Passgen::generate(:number => 3)
  => ["REdOigTkdI", "PQu8DsV9WZ", "qptKLbw8YQ"]

  >> Passgen::generate(:seed => 5)
  => "JoV9M2qjiK"
  >> Passgen::generate(:seed => 5) # Will generate same password again
  => "JoV9M2qjiK"

  >> Passgen::generate(:seed => :default) # Will set random seed...
  => "SI8QDBdV98"
  >> Passgen::generate(:seed => :default) # and hence give different password
  => "tHHU5HLBAn"
